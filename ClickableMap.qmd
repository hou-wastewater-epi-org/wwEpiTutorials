Can we have an interactive map where you can click a WWTP and have a graph pop up? (so like clickable tabs, but instead of tabs, it's a map)

Use case: sending weekly reports of the weekly wwepi system to the health department

-   1 map of 37 wwtps

-   1 time series data set (visualization) for each of the wwtps

-   each week, a report is sent where each time series plot has one new observation

    -   needs to run by just reading in a new data file

Starting point:

-   <https://tmieno2.github.io/R-as-GIS-for-Economists/interactive-view-of-an-sf-object.html>

-   your code for the mapping of a gif

Goals:

1.  minimal exampleâ€“ one clickable map that allows you to see the 37 time series plots
2.  Create tutorial for anything that isn't easy for an R user comfortable with sf, ggplot, tidyverse
3.  Create a demonstration of the weekly workflow (if minimal example is created using wwtp_070824.Rdata, then show how to update the minimal example using a new data set like wwtp_071524.Rdata)

Stretch goal (don't think about this now)

-   have a slider for time points, and clickable map

-   have the ability to filter with different viruses
