# Time Series Data {.unnumbered}

When data are collected and referenced in time, such as weekly wastewater surveillance, the data may be correlated in time. In other words, the data are not independent.

Since independence is an assumption of many common statistical models, such as linear regression, other tools are required when temporal correlation is present.

These tutorials demonstrate how to check for the presence of temporal correlation, and how to apply models that account for it.

Note: these tutorials use synthetic data.
