# What to put in an email question about code (in a single email)?

1.  Name of file you are referencing
2.  Code line number and name of code chunk
3.  Screenshot/copy paste of error

Also: make sure you close Rstudio and run the code in a new session with a clear workspace to "simulate" what the other person will see when you run your code.

Include any information about caching/reading in a file/expected run time: <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/caching.html#knitr-cache> (or outputting data files so that the code runs faster)

Make sure you push!

Feel free to use our Friday email as an example!

Be clear about whether you're asking someone to render in individual *file* or the entire quaro book/website.
