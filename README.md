### Licensing

Because code and intellectual work have different licensing needs, a separate `LICENSE` file is contained in each folder and applies to the files in that folder:

-   Files in the main folder are licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3 (GPL-3).

-   Files in the `Data` folder are licensed under the Creative Commons NonCommercial ShareAlike (CC by-NC-SA) license.

We are happy to discuss the possibility of an alternate (dual) license for the files in either folder. If you encounter a situation where you are unable to use the work for desired purposes, for example, a license compatibility issue, please reach out to Â info\@hou-wastewater-epi.org.
